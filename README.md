I'm a web developer now.

Very simple webapp that assigns players and coach of a team to watch each others POVs.

Just open the html file in your browser to get started. Player names are stored locally so you don't need to type them in every time :)

If your team does not have a coach, leave the field empty.

Each player will watch a teammate's demo and write down a few things that they will discuss. Discussion should take 15-20 minutes and should be done outside of teampractice, if possible.

Innovation means that one player should prepare a play, setup, strat or whatever that the team will implement into their game.

If there is a coach, the discussion *can* be done during teampractice in two 'rounds'. *vs.* means that coach and player should either play some 1v1 or talk about that player's innovation.
